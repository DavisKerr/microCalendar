Next Major Goal:

- Think about adding an options box on the right of the goal box to simplify the gesture detection. This also makes
    it easier to find all of the goal editing operations, like the progress page.

- Change Goal Progress to a linked list holding the object. This will make inserting and removing progress very fast.
It will not suffer much in search performance because it is more than likely that every element will have to be displayed anyway.
